            <p>Here are Kosupure our aim was to simplify the cosplay buying and selling process, with so many fragmented sites it can be difficult to have a commonplace that removes all the excess clutter. Our other goal was to do this while maintaining cheaper fees than other platforms, at our launch Kosupure is taking NO CUTS OR LISTING FEES from your sales. That means, the only fees you incur will be through our payment processer Stripe which is one of the most secure and user friendly payment systems around.</p>
